# personal-projects
These are my beginner projects from learning programming in python. Projects include a variety of applications and small programs that i have built 
Multi.py is a simple dash data visualiation project that i have undertaken to present the car population by make ( brand ) in singapore from the years ranging 2005 to 2017. 
My application is intereactive and features a graph with a year slider which users can adjust to view the make up of car populations in singapore for their desired year.
Thank you and please provide me any feeddback/input as to how i could improve my work thank you !!
